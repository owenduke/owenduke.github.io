In 2025 I hiked ~1300 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail in California, over the course of three months. These are some of the highlights, compiled from the email updates I wrote along the trail.

Section 1: Campo to Julian
------

Today got to the first major resupply point on the PCT: Julian, California. 77 miles down, 1180 to go! Here are some pictures from the first segment.  

Last view of the US/Mexico border from the trail.

A Jeffery pine near Mount Laguna. The bark of these smells like vanilla and bourbon to meâ€”everyone describes it differently.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_1/image1.jpeg" %}

Most of the view from this first section looks like this.

Sunset from camp on day 3.

A plume of smoke on the horizon from a prescribed burn (I checked to make sure).
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_1/image6.jpeg" %}

Free pie and ice cream at Momâ€™s Pies in Julian! And a reunion with all the folks I met on the way.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_1/image4.jpeg" %}

Next stop is Paradise Valley!

Section 2: Julian to Idyllwild.
----
Iâ€™m hunkered down in Idyllwild, CA, waiting out a storm before heading back up into the San Jacinto mountains. So far Iâ€™ve gotten 170 miles into the trail! Here are some of the highlights of the last section. 

A flowering cactusy friend on the hike up from interstate 78. There were some trail angels making pancakes for hikers under the overpass, so I was very well fed for this sectionâ€¦
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image0.jpeg" %}

Meadows coming into Warner Springs. This section was lovely, full of cows, and very flat. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image1.jpeg" %}

Clothes drying on the fence at the Warner Springs community resource center. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image2.jpeg" %}

Lovely campsite under an oak tree by a stream outside of Warner Springs. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image3.jpeg" %}

Zero-mile day with the Murrieta family at their ranch/winery. I met these folks the day before on the trail and they invited me to rest for a day with them.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image4.jpeg" %}

Lenticular cloud over the San Jacinto mountains in the distance. These signify very high winds, which turned out to be accurateâ€¦
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image5.jpeg" %}

A manzanita tree high up on a windy ridge. The colors are even more vibrant in person. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image6.jpeg" %}

Ice scales after a windy, freezing night. This altitude had 60 mph winds all night and constant freezing fog. Quite an experience to walk through. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image7.jpeg" %}

I decided to come down from the trail into Idyllwild to wait for warmer weather, and I ran into the Mayor! His name is Max, and heâ€™s the fourth generation of Mayors of Idyllwild in his family. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image8.jpeg" %}

Chilling at the Idyllwild public library (photo credit Timber, who snuck up on me) 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_2/image9.jpeg" %}

This afternoon Iâ€™m heading back up for the next sectionâ€”100 miles, to big bear city. 

Section 3: Idyllwild to Wrightwood
----
Iâ€™m writing this from the lovely town of Wrightwood, CAâ€”342 miles into the trail. The last section has been a bit of a whirlwind, including big weather extremes and some very long days. Here are some of the highlights. 

Snow camping the first night out of Idyllwild. I was making the first tracks on the trail for 8 miles or so. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image0.jpeg" %}

Looking west from the slope of San Jacinto. Apparently Idyllwild (under those clouds) was having some nasty sleet, but up high it was lovely. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image1.jpeg" %}

The summit of San Jacinto. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image2.jpeg" %}

A really cool atmospheric effect coming down fuller ridgeâ€”the clouds are contained on one side of the valley. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image3.jpeg" %}

Hanging out at Nitzyâ€™s Hiker Hostel in Browning. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image4.jpeg" %}

Fields of wildflowers on the way out of Cabazon. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image5.jpeg" %}

The indomitable Quinn joined me for a weekend! 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image14.jpeg" %}

Ty taking a nap in a very Ty-shaped log after 10 miles of rock hopping up mission creek. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image6.jpeg" %}

A very photogenic donkey near big bear city. There was a whole herd, but this one stared me down until I took a picture. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image7.jpeg" %}

One of the pools at Deep Creek hot springs. I hung out for about three hours and had a spa day!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image8.jpeg" %}

Turns out the PCT goes right by the entrance to the Mines of Moria! Who knew. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image9.jpeg" %}

Unbelievably lush walk along the Deep Creek floodplain. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image10.jpeg" %}

Overlooking Silverwood lake (also had a lovely swim here). 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image11.jpeg" %}

Sandstone cliffs near Cajon Pass. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image12.jpeg" %}

The sign to the famed McDonalds that marks the end of this section. Donâ€™t let anyone tell you ice cream isnâ€™t a breakfast food. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_3/image13.jpeg" %}

The next 40 miles of the trail are closed because of a forest fire last year, so Iâ€™m skipping up to Mount Baden Powell tomorrow to continue north. 

Section 4: Wrightwood to Agua Dulce
----
Iâ€™m writing this from Serenityâ€™s Oasis (a well-stocked backyard along the trail) in Agua Dulce, near mile 450 of the PCT. The last few days have had more crazy weather, ranging from high winds and thick fog to clear skies. Here are a few highlights. 

Anita, the trail angel I was staying with in Wrightwood, teaches nursing and adopted this practice dummy that the university was throwing away. It terrifies me. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image0.jpeg" %}

Some cool clouds coming up the north face of Mt. Baden-Powell. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image1.jpeg" %}

Looking out from Baden-Powell at the burn zone of the 2024 Bridge Fire. The PCT was closed in this section, so the trail angels of wrightwood organized a shuttle to get around it. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image8.jpeg" %}

Really cool tree near the summit of Baden-Powell. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image2.jpeg" %}

Fog rolling in from the sea in the early afternoon. I didnâ€™t realize it at the time, but Iâ€™d be living in this fog for the next two days. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image3.jpeg" %}

Indian Paintbrush along the trail. The moisture from the fog and recent rain has made the desert bloom. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image4.jpeg" %}

The highway 14 underpass. This tunnel has really cool acousticsâ€”I hung out for a while making spooky noises. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image5.jpeg" %}

The Vasquez Rocks near Agua Dulce. These are very cool and have been the set of a shocking number of movies and shows, partly because theyâ€™re so close to LA, including may Star Trek episodes and Blazing Saddles. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image6.jpeg" %}

One month in, the beard is getting a bit puffy ðŸ˜‚. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image7.jpeg" %}

The Serenityâ€™s Oasis in Agua Dulce, which is also a weed farm, is a popular place to take a day off. Theyâ€™ve got soap! And nice flat ground! 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_4/image9.jpeg" %}

Section 5: Agua Dulce to Kennedy Meadows South
----


Iâ€™m writing this from Grumpy Bearâ€™s Retreat in Kennedy Meadows, at mile 703 of the PCT! This is a significant milestone because it marks the end of the southern California desert section and the start of the Sierra Nevada. The next section will take me up into the snowy mountains, over Forester Pass (the highest point on the trail) and possibly with a side trip to summit Mt. Whitney (the highest point in the contiguous US). 
This last section really felt like a grand finale of the desert. I had a taste of just about every kind of weather and landscape Iâ€™ve had since I started, and at 136 miles it was my longest stretch between resupply so far. Iâ€™ve been more than ever blown away by how this trail runs on generosityâ€”of hikers and of the locals who support the trail. 

A feast in Tahachapie. Abel (at the head of the table) hosted us in his beautiful home and made some delicious food. He also made the truck and train on top of the cabinet! 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image0.jpeg" %}

Right after leaving Tehachapi we had a blizzard/hailstorm. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image1.jpeg" %}

Cowboy camping under a Joshua Tree. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image2.jpeg" %}

One of the three large water caches along this section. These are maintained by local self-organized  volunteers. Without them I wouldâ€™ve had to carry water for 32 miles of hot desert, which would have about doubled my pack weight. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image3.jpeg" %}

The wildflowers in this section were unbelievable. The shaded faces of the hills were completely covered in purple and yellow. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image4.jpeg" %}

A representative snippet of the trail from this section. Some impressive construction went into building this. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image5.jpeg" %}

On day two of this section I passed someone going the other way who gave me two extra meals, including my favorite flavor of mountain house. The extra food let me skip one of the intermediate towns and stick with the same group for the whole section. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image6.jpeg" %}

Right after I got to the resupply store we were hit by a huge downpour and hailstorm. At sunset it gave us this awesome double rainbow. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image7.jpeg" %}

Yours truly with one of the famously enormous pancakes at Grumpy Bearâ€™s. The pancakes are all-you-can-eat, but almost no one finishes even one. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_5/image8.jpeg" %}
The next section will be snow, snow, snow! Iâ€™m picking up more gear and clothing here, so I should be warm. 

Section 6: Kennedy Meadows to Bishop
----
Iâ€™ve finished the first leg of the sierra section of the PCT: 100 miles from Kennedy Meadows to Kearsarge pass. This section has been by far the most challenging so farâ€”snow hiding almost all the trail, tricky river crossings, steep ascents, and big temperature changes. Itâ€™s also been breathtakingly beautiful and very rewarding, and Iâ€™ve had an awesome team to tackle it with. 

The gang leaving the Kennedy Meadows general store to head up into the mountains. From left: Kiss, Zigzag, Narly, and myself (PopTart) 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image0.jpeg" %}

Crossing the bridge over the Kern River at dawn on our first snowy day. The birds are a colony of swallows who live under the bridge and come out a dawn and dusk. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image1.jpeg" %}

Our first snowy forest. The trail vanished almost immediately, and the sun turned the snow into knee-deep slush in some places.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image3.jpeg" %}

Looking back south over the desert behind.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image4.jpeg" %}

Sometimes the trees give way to big open snowfields that become meadows later in the summer. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image5.jpeg" %}

Camping by chicken spring lake at 11,000 feet. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image7.jpeg" %}

To avoid the soft snow, we started hiking at around 3 am each day, wayfinding by starlight.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image13.jpeg" %}

We got about halfway up Mt. Whitney before deciding to turn around to avoid softening snow. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image15.jpeg" %}

Narly caught some fish! They were delicious. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image14.jpeg" %}

Yours truly at the top of forester pass, the highest point on the PCT. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image10.jpeg" %}

The north face of Forester pass is an enormous snowfield at 12,000 feet. It was a crazy place to be walking. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image9.jpeg" %}

A snowy ridge on the way down from forester pass. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_6/image6.jpeg" %}

Section 7: Bishop to Mammoth Lakes
----
This last section has had more snow, more passes, and more lovely streams. The highlights for me were definitely Muir Pass, which sits between two spectacular snowy valleys dotted with frozen lakes, and our lovely campsite by Grouse Meadows. Enjoy!

The gang getting ready to head back into the mountains over Kearsarge pass.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image0.jpeg" %}

A magnificent tree (some sort of cedar?) in our campsite the night after Glen Pass. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image1.jpeg" %}

Looking south across Grouse Meadow. We liked this spot so much we stayed here for almost a whole day. I spent four hours sitting on a rock watching the golden trout and the caustics. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image2.jpeg" %}

Sunrise over the approach to Muir Pass.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image3.jpeg" %}

Walking down from Muir Pass through an enormous snow field. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image4.jpeg" %}

The start of Evolution Creek in the valley above Muir Pass. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image5.jpeg" %}

A slow curve of the San Joaquin river, a few miles downstream from the last photo.  
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image6.jpeg" %}

One of the spectacular waterfalls in the San Joaquin watershed. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image7.jpeg" %}

Snow Flowers growing along the north shore of Lake Edison. These have some wacky biologyâ€”they eat fungus around tree roots instead of photosynthesizing. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image8.jpeg" %}

Eating a PopTart on the top of Silver pass, with some stylish snow gaiters I picked up in a hiker box. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_7/image9.jpeg" %}

The next section should be slightly less snowy, and includes a side trip to Yosemite Valley! 

Section 8: Mammoth Lakes to Kennedy Meadows North
----
Yesterday I got to mile 1000 of the PCT! 
This last section has been an absolute blast and included a side trip to Yosemite Valley. The snow has been melting rapidly, which gave us more clear trail but also new challenges. 

Our first day out of Mammoth included a detour to the lovely Redâ€™s Meadow hot spring. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image0.jpeg" %}

In many places the snow has been gone long enough for the plants to wake up, making this section much greener than the last.{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image1.jpeg" %}

A newly melted lake across the valley from the trail. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image2.jpeg" %}

One of the more spectacular tent sites of the trip so far. Unfortunately this one was also home to some voracious kangaroo mice who stole four socks that I left out to dry.  
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image3.jpeg" %}

A gourmet trail dinner: ramen and mashed potatoes with sausage, cheese, and fresh wild onions. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image4.jpeg" %}

Yet another stunning alpine lake!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image5.jpeg" %}

The mist trail in Yosemite Valley. It was a bit surreal to suddenly be a day hiker. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image6.jpeg" %}

Liberty Cap in Yosemite Valley, with Nevada Falls in the foreground. We climbed the cap up the back, which is a bit less steepâ€¦
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image7.jpeg" %}

The easier way up Liberty Cap. Without full backpacks and with denser air (this is 5000â€™ lower than weâ€™re acclimated to) we felt like superman.  
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image8.jpeg" %}

We got a ride back to the trailhead in a converted sprinter van. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image9.jpeg" %}

The melting snow sometimes turns the trail into a river. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image16.jpeg" %}

Yet another spectacular alpine lake! 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image11.jpeg" %}

During peak melt the snow develops dimples (â€˜sun cupsâ€™) that grow by focusing sunlight into themselves. Theyâ€™re very pretty but treacherous to walk onâ€”the ridges remain icy while the centers turn into deep slush. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image12.jpeg" %}

Yours truly at the 1000 mile marker!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image13.jpeg" %}

The last day before Sonora Pass included this amazing ridge walk. The terrain is getting more deserty again, with reddish gravel replacing the granite slabs. We had to bail off the ridge early because of a thunderstorm but got a ride into town and a good meal.  
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_8/image14.jpeg" %}

The next stop is Lake Tahoe!

Section 9: Kennedy Meadows North to Truckee
----
Im currently riding a bus from Reno to Mt. Shasta. Over the last section I made it to Truckee (mile 1154), stopping in Lake Tahoe for a rest day. Iâ€™ve only got two more weeks before I need to get off trail so Iâ€™ve decided to skip north to the Oregon border and hike south through the Trinity Alps for a final 150 mile section.  

We had some intense afternoon thunderstorms the three days after Sonora Passâ€”this one dumped about an inch and a half of chickpea-sized hail on us before moving on. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image1.jpeg" %}

The area north of Sonora Pass was alternate deserty rock and pine forest, with patchy snow throughout. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image2.jpeg" %}

This tree has a nose!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image3.jpeg" %}

Some cool rocks the day before arriving at Lake Tahoe. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image4.jpeg" %}

Yet another stunning alpine lake! This one has almost completely filled its valleyâ€”just over the bank on the right is a sheer cliff. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image5.jpeg" %}

Kiss and ZigZag taking a shade break under one of the magnificent treesâ€”cedars I thinkâ€”along the dry ridges. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image6.jpeg" %}

First view of Lake Tahoe in the distance, with yet another thunderstorm rolling in. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image7.jpeg" %}

A glorious swim in the surprisingly warm Lake Tahoe. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image12.jpeg" %}

After leaving Lake Tahoe the PCT joins the Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT) for ~50 miles on the ridge to the west of the lake. Watching the sun rise over the lake as we walked along was unforgettable. I would definitely recommend the TRT to anyone looking for a shorter backpacking trip in the area. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image9.jpeg" %}

The other side of the same ridge, which was covered in wildflowers when we crossed it. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_9/image10.jpeg" %}

This next section will be my last on the PCT for the season! Iâ€™ll have walked just about half the trailâ€”Oregon and Washington will have to wait for another time. 

Section 10: Seiad Valley to Mt. Shasta
----
Iâ€™m writing this on the flight home from Reno to Austin! After 3 months and 1,300 miles Iâ€™m saying goodbye to the PCT (for now!) and heading back to normal life. Itâ€™s been an absolute blastâ€”everything Iâ€™d hoped and moreâ€”and itâ€™s sad to go home after having only hiked half the trail. On the other hand, after three months I am a bit excited to do something other than walk every dayâ€¦

For this final section I skipped up to the northern border of California and hiked south 150 miles to interstate 5. This section passes near Mt. Shasta and through some lovely mountainsâ€”much more low-key than the Sierra, and a great section to end on. 

The bus from Reno dropped me off in Mt. Shasta (the town), which sits at the base of Mt. Shasta (the mountain). The latter is quite a sight, especially from a rite aid parking lot, but thatâ€™s California for you!  
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image0.jpeg" %}

Jeff and Becky (front) were in town for a protest and gave me a ride back with them to their home in Seiad Valley for the night, near my starting trailhead. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image1.jpeg" %}

The first few miles followed a creek at around 1,500â€™. The moisture and low elevation made this the lushest section of trail Iâ€™ve encountered yet. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image2.jpeg" %}

The local snails love the moisture! I also saw a bear on the far side of the creek, but didnâ€™t get a good picture of it.
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image3.jpeg" %}

This section has had lots of fires recently, creating what I like to call a Backcountry Jungle-gym!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image21.jpeg" %}

The first night I camped near this magnificent tree. Itâ€™s got a little bed built into it! Or maybe itâ€™s an altar?
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image4.jpeg" %}

Looking up from the tree-bed into the lichen. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image5.jpeg" %}

A herd of deer came by at sunset and hung out in the campsite all night. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image6.jpeg" %}

Most of this section followed a series of ridges at about 8,000â€™, leading to a drier landscape and many wildflowers. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image8.jpeg" %}

A bear print that appears to have six toes?!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image7.jpeg" %}

In some of the older burn sections the wildflowers have grown back. They make a sharp contrast with the still-standing burned trunks. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image11.jpeg" %}

More flowers!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image20.jpeg" %}

More flowers!
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image12.jpeg" %}

Mt. Shasta in the distance, looking properly volcanic. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image18.jpeg" %}

For some reason this kind of lichen only starts growing 6â€™ off the ground, which makes a very cool visual effect. It reminds me of an Andy Goldsworthy sculpture. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image13.jpeg" %}

More flowers! According to ChatGPT these are Western Azaleas.  {% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image14.jpeg" %}

The section ends in Castle Crags state park, which has some really cool glacial rock formations. {% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image15.jpeg" %}

Donna and Randy hosted me for the night in Mt. Shasta, and I took a bus back to Reno in the morning. 
{% include image-wrapper.html file="/images/pct_images/section_10/image16.jpeg" %}

And thatâ€™s it! No more trail notes for a while at least. Oregon and Washington will have to waitâ€”hopefully not too long though. Thank you for coming on the journey with me!

Welcome! I'm a PhD student in the Electrical Engineering department at UT Austin. I work in the [Fan Group](https://sites.utexas.edu/lfan/) on microwave/optical transduction for quantum information applications. Before this I was a research engineer at [Commonwealth Fusion Systems](https://www.cfs.energy), where I led a test campaign to improve the radiation tolerance of the fiber-optic quench detection system in the SPARC tokamak. Outside the lab you can find me [woodworking](/personal/woodworking), [hiking](/personal/pct), and playing old-time fiddle.

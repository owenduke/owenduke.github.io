# Abstract
Quench detection apparatuses and methods for high-temperature- superconducting (HTS) cables are described. An optical fiber may form part of the HTS cable and may include a plurality of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), at least some of which exhibit different center wavelengths. The FBGs are arranged in some embodiments such that the center wavelengths of the respective FBGs increase along the length of the HTS cable.

# My Contribution
This patent describes the quench detection system I helped develop for the pulsed magnets in the SPARC tokamak. In particular, it describes a distribution of Fiber Bragg Grating thermometers along a superconducting cable which allows for quench detection in the presence of background cable strain and fiber attenuation. I developed the FBG pattern used in the final production QD system for SPARC. See our [article on the PIT-VIPER cable design](/publications/2024-10-04-high-current-density-superconducting-cable) for a demonstration of the effectiveness of this technology.
